Final project for ECE491 (Program Analysis) by Jonathan Lam and Derek Lee

---

### Build

##### Prerequisites
Agda is required for this project. It may be installed using the `stack` or `cabal` package managers. Assuming `stack` is installed:

```bash
$ stack install Agda     # this will take a while
$ agda-mode setup        # Emacs agda-mode setup
```

##### Executing
TODO: how to use Agda? Emacs commands?

```bash
$ agda red-black.agda
```
